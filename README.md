# Overview

This repo contains Python code to perform Linear Regression using Gradient Descent. The code doesn't use a machine learning framework. Instead it provides a lower level implementation of the algorithm with a view to being more instructive to the reader. For a detailed explanation of the code see the tutorial post at: [https://www.iharris.net/machine%20learning/2018/06/11/introduction-to-linear-regression.html](https://www.iharris.net/machine%20learning/2018/06/11/introduction-to-linear-regression.html).

# Dependencies

* Pandas  - used for reading data
* NumPy   - used for scientific calculations (matrix operations, random number generation, etc.)
